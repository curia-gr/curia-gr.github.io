# Welcome to the CURIA-GR Workshop on
# Can AI Ever Truly Understand Culture?
Questioning whether current LLMs simulate cultural knowledge or actually reason about it.

# Description

This workshop explores the question of whether artificial intelligence can truly understand culture, or whether its cultural awareness is merely a (statistical) illusion. Against the backdrop of the multilingual Greater Region, it brings together researchers from computational linguistics, computer science, humanities subjects, and the social sciences to debate how cultural reasoning can be measured, tested, and ultimately improved in large language models. Central questions include whether LLMs can distinguish between related but distinct cultures, how to define and evaluate “cultural sensitivity” in a clearly defined way, and whether AI systems should adapt to local contexts or remain culturally neutral.

The program will feature one or two keynote talks by leading researchers, thematic discussions, and a poster session for which abstracts will be invited. The aim is to create a space for critical reflection and collaborative exchange on the opportunities and risks that arise when AI systems encounter cultural complexity in multilingual, border regions such as Luxembourg and its neighbours.


# Questions

- To what extent can LLMs distinguish between related but distinct cultures (e.g. Luxembourgish vs. German vs. French)?
- How do we measure “cultural sensitivity” in a way that is both rigorous and fair?
- Should AI be culturally adaptive (changing responses based on user’s context), or culturally neutral?
- What risks emerge when AI fails to respect local cultural norms in multilingual, border regions like the Greater Region?
